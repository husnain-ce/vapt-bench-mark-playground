## Build and Test Instructions

### Build
This project uses Android Studio with Java. To build the debug APK from the terminal:
```bash
# Navigate into the source code directory first
cd AtlanticBanking/
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
The APK will be located at app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk.

### How to Test

1. Install the application on an Android device or emulator.

2. Test component accessibility using ADB commands:
    ```bash
    # Test money transfer access
    adb shell am start -n com.atlanticbank.mobile/.TransferActivity
    
    # Test administrative functions
    adb shell am start -n com.atlanticbank.mobile/.AdminPanelActivity
    
    # Test profile management
    adb shell am start -n com.atlanticbank.mobile/.ProfileEditActivity
    
    # Test payment processing
    adb shell am start -n com.atlanticbank.mobile/.PaymentConfirmActivity
    ```

3. Verify that activities can be launched without authentication.

### Success Condition

A successful test requires the tool to identify activities that can be accessed directly without proper authentication flow.

**Example of successful findings**:
- Activities marked as `android:exported="true"` in AndroidManifest.xml
- Direct component access bypassing the login screen
- Ability to access sensitive functions without user verification
