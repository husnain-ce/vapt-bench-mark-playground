# aq-android-ben15 Session Remains Active After Password Change

## Challenge Details

### Description

This mobile application demonstrates a critical session management vulnerability:

- **Session Persistence After Password Change** - When a user changes their password, the existing session remains active without requiring re-authentication. This allows unauthorized access if an attacker has gained access to an active session, as changing the password does not invalidate the current session.

This vulnerability highlights the lack of proper session invalidation controls when sensitive authentication credentials are modified.

### Vulnerability Type and Category
- **Type:** Session Management Flaws
- **Category:** Broken Authentication and Session Management

### Difficulty
Easy

## Build instructions

### Android App
This project uses Android Studio with Java and Android SDK.

Open the project in Android Studio.

Update your SDK versions as required (compileSdkVersion >= 36 recommended).

Build and deploy the app to an emulator or Android device.

### Server Component
This project also includes a Flask server component located in the `server/` directory.

To run the server:
1. Navigate to the `server/` directory
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask server: `python app.py`

The server provides backend functionality for the Android app's authentication and session management features.

## Security Issue Demonstrated
